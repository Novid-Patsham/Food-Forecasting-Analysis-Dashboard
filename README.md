# Food-Forecasting-Analysis-Dashboard

In this Tableau-driven data analysis journey, I delve into a vast dataset comprising product details, categories, regions, and more belonging to a huge Superstore franchise. Meanwhile, I analyze data for a meal delivery company utilising historical demand data, product features, and fulfillment center information. 

My goal is to craft a comprehensive Tableau story that provides nuanced insights into demand levels, helping both procurement and staffing decisions across fulfillment centers. I focus on making a full report, showing which areas do well and identifying opportunities for improvement through visual insights.
